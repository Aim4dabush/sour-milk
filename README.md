### What I Learned

I enjoyed learning about useContext. It really help with passing information through the different components to control the opacity of the website.

I learned a lot about state. I had to use state to control the different pop up overlays. I also used it to control the opacity of the page.

The biggest thing about state was the star rating system. I was able to figure out how to use state to control hover and click yellow star effect. With the help of some event functions.
